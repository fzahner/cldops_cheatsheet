\section{Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)}
\textit{"Keep the site up, whatever it takes"} \\
\textbf{SL Indicators:} A measurement (e.g. Response latency over a period of 10 min)
\textbf{SL Objectives:} A Objective (e.g. 99.9\% below 5ms)
\textbf{SL Agreements:} A economic incentive (e.g. or less bonus)
\textbf{Error Budget:} 1 - SLO (e.g. 100\% - 99.9\% = 0.1\%) \\

\textbf{The four golden signals: } latency, traffic, errors, and saturation.

\subsection{Outage Handling}
Goals: 1. Minimize impact (Automated, fast detection; good diagnostic information, practice remidation) 2. Prevent reoccurrence (handle event, write post-mortem)
